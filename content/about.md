## About

The OSU Security Club was founded in 2014 by Daniel Reichert, and was guided by Dr. Yeongjin Jang until 2023. Currently, the club is advised by Dr. Zane Ma. We focus on gaining hands-on experience with exploiting vulnerabilities in systems and networks, defending against these attacks, and getting involved in the security community. Thereâ€™s no experience or knowledge required, only an interest in learning more about this incredibly important and expanding field!
