Ni Haowdy members!

Last night, we had our first lockpicking meeting of the school year! Zane led us through an introduction to lockpicking and the various locks we have. Lockpicking is a great outlet for puzzle-solving as well as a practical tool if you are ever locked out of our apartment :)

We will continue to have lockpicking meetings throughout the year, so keep an eye out for the next one!
