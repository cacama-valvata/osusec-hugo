Last weekend, OSUSEC's cyberdefense team flew out to Chicago to compete in the Department of Energy's **Cyberforce Competition!** For 4 out of 6 members of the team, this was their very first time in a cyberdefense competition, and they absolutely rocked it! The team trained on Industrial Control Systems, system administration, and incident response in preparation, and came away with 15th out of 95 teams!

Thank you for everyone who helped put on Cyberforce. We had a blast and are looking forward to next year's as well!
