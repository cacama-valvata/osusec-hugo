Good Thursday, members!

Last night we got to hear from Isabel Boona from Battelle! She presented on her work in reverse-engineering microchips, and how her previous work in materials science helped her transition into this unique line of work! This work is especially important when verifying that systems have been built without unintentional bugs and malicious backdoors.

Battelle is one of the largest non-profits dedicated to research in the United States, and manages many of the National Laboratories on behalf of the Department of Energy, as well as doing Top Secret contract work with the federal government. They are a frequent presence at the cybersecurity competitions that OSUSEC attends, so we're very happy to have had them present this week!

If you're interested in a clearance job or internship next Summer, please check out Battelle's openings here: [https://jobs.battelle.org/us/en/cyber](https://jobs.battelle.org/us/en/cyber).
