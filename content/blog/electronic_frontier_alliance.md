As OSUSEC moves into 2024 and beyond, we are taking a closer look at how our actions shape the world around us. Because of this, we are choosing to endorse the Electronic Frontier Alliance's five core principles:

1. Free Expression
2. Security
3. Privacy
4. Creativity
5. Access to Knowledge

We believe that advances in technology, and specifically cybersecurity, can be a critical tool in making people's lives better. But in equal measure, it can be a tool to stifle the human spirit. By following these principles, we want to ensure that our work has a positive impact on the world.
