Howdy hackers!

Last night, we had the fantastic Jonathan Keller give a talk about how he used his pwn skills in order to get a world record in a Tool Assisted Speedrun of Super Metroid! Thank you everyone who showed up :) He discussed the game's internal mechanics, how the exploit works, and his experience developing the real-world exploit as a cybersecurity student and as someone who enjoys retro games.
