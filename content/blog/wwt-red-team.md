Last Thursday, we entered two teams into WWT's red team CyberRange! The competition tasked us with breaking into a fake ransomware group's infrastructure by several means such as Windows exploits and remote code execution on PHP. Several other universities participated as well :)

Overall we took home 2nd place and 4th place! Great work everyone!
