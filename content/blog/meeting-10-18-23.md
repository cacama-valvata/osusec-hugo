Ni Haowdy!

Last night, we hosted Dr. Kelsey Fulton of the Colorado School of Mines. They talked about their research into the why and the how that software developers introduce security vulnerabilities into their code, and some potential solutions for it. We had some great conversations about the attitudes in software development spaces and how we might be able to change that for the future. Please reach out to [Dr. Fulton](https://kfulton121.github.io/) if you are interested in working with them on further research!

Watch out for next week's meeting which will feature Battelle talking about the sort of cyber work they do!
